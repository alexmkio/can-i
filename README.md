# Can I go look at a tree?

Can I go look at a tree? was a Mod 3 solo project in the Front End program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The assignment was to build out a multi-page application using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) to create a product which helps a niche audience solve a unique problem.

The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html).

The project is deployed [here]().
